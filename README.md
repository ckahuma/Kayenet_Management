Qn is below!!

Kayenet is a business startup located within Kampala and deals mainly in ladies’ bags with 3 distributed shops – Nakawa (NAK), Kawempe (KAW) and Mengo (MEN). The three shops are operated by three different sales persons working in them.

The management of the shops by the shop Administrator is currently by paper and calculator and lately there has been increased number of mistakes especially on the sales information captured. The shop Administrator is now looking for a way (network application) in which most of the financial operations can be automated and he specifically has the following requirements:
    a) The administrator (manager) is the super user and should have an account manually provisioned in the system. He should also be able to perform the following tasks;
        a. Create and manage accounts for the three sales persons. The details of the sales persons include (first name, last name, user name, phone number, password, address, reference person name). 
        b. Retrieve product listing with quantities (sold and available)
        c. Retrieve daily, weekly and monthly sales with computed sales amounts for the specific shops and/or sales persons
    b) The sales person should be able to;
        a. Access the system using the provided credentials
        b. Input the bag items to the system with the following required information
            i. The bag ID (A combination of the shop (three letter code) and an automatically generated number appended e.g NAK-01 for the first bag item entered to the Nakawa shop)
            ii. Name
            iii. Short description
            iv. Image of the bag
            v. Price of the bag
            vi. Quantity
        c. Enter daily sales to the system by selecting from the bag items in the system and their quantities sold
        d. Retrieve product listing for only the items in their shops
        e. Check own daily, weekly and monthly sales (Items and amounts)
